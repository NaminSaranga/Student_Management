This project is a MERN project which is developed using MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs and NodeJs. In here I used JWT (JSON web tokens) to authentication purposes. There are 2 roles who are student and admin for this project and here I implemented the authorization also for provide specific user to access.
